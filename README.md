#Angular Two Resource REST API
##Assignment for Code Fellows 401

Create a C(reate) R(ead) U(pdate) D(estroy) interface for your two resource JSON api using Angular. When doing an data transation, don't refetch the entire list, just insert the returned new object or remove the object from the list. Also, make sure that when you cancel your edit it shows the original value (don't just use a getAll()). Submit as a PR to your Angular Client Assignment. (there is not a starting point in the organization for this assignment).
